### How to use
Read the enclosed readme.txt for details. You need to switch off EAC on the game to make the camera work. 
The readme contains this information. 

### HUD toggle
A ubisoft game without a hud toggle is hard to take shots of, so I made a HUD toggle with 3D Migoto. 
You can find it here: https://mega.nz/#!FQQShJyS!Ipg4CycflblD2LvZdlfQMgl29ptx_yqPX_HA03u5hoU  
It also contains a readme.txt file with the info you need to install it.
