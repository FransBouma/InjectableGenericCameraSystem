If you ask me a question which is answered in the enclosed readme.txt, so i.o.w. you didn't read it at all, 
you owe me a new AAA game. Easy, right? 

### FAQ

* **"Will you update the camera when an update breaks it?"**  
When I'm still playing the game, I'll update it. However after that I likely won't, unless you're one of my friends and I really have no other things to do with my sparse free time (read: even then likely not). Not that I want you to have a bad time, but this is a hobby, not work. Creating these cameras takes a lot of time, and keeping them up to date with the latest release isn't simple: often things have changed that much that I have to find the particular hook again to intercept, which is kind of tedious after a while especially if I'm not using the camera myself anymore. 
* **"It doesn't work!"**  
That's unfortunate.
* **"I'm too stupid to read the readme it doesn't seem to work!"**  
Read the readme. Oh and you owe me an AAA game now.
