Injectable camera for Titanfall 2
============================

Current supported game version: v2.0.11+ (Origin version)  
Camera version: 1.0.1  
Camera release binaries: https://github.com/FransBouma/InjectableGenericCameraSystem/releases/tag/TF2_101  
Credits: Otis_Inf. 

**USE IN SINGLE PLAYER ONLY. NO EXCEPTIONS / EXCUSES**

### How to use
Read the enclosed readme.txt for details, really! Run the game as **administrator** otherwise it won't work.

### Important
This is the last public binary release of a camera I've made. All potentially future cameras will be released as
source only. It simply takes too much time to polish them up to release quality. I'll hand out binaries to 
friends if necessary.

### Support
There's no support. If the camera breaks while I'm using it, it'll be updated, otherwise you're out of luck and
you have to fix it yourself (the source is right here on github!). Please don't ask questions like how to use the
camera, how to build the source etc. as I won't answer them if I don't know you. 

### HUD Toggle
Use the hud toggle by The Janitor: http://www.moddb.com/games/titanfall-2/downloads/toggle-hud5

### Acknowledgements
